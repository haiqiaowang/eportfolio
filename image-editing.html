          <h3>Design Description</h3>
          <p>
            This book cover visualizes learning as both perception and expression, inspired by Elliot Eisner’s
            <em>The Arts and the Creation of Mind</em>. The black-and-white photograph of a man in an art gallery
            represents reflection, careful observation, and intellectual engagement—the act of “learning to see.”
            In contrast, the warm-toned piano keys convey creativity, emotion, and the sensory depth of
            “learning to hear.”
          </p>

          <h3>Tools & Techniques</h3>
          <p>
            Using GIMP, I combined two photographs through layered editing and gradient blending to create a smooth
            transition between the visual and auditory symbolism. The minimalist typography emphasizes clarity and
            balance, echoing Eisner’s belief that the arts cultivate nuanced ways of knowing and understanding the world.

          <h3>Design Description</h3>
          <p>
            The logo for <strong>Infinite Keys Studio</strong> symbolizes the endless potential of learning through
            piano education. The infinity symbol communicates continuous growth, while the left loop incorporates piano
            keys to connect structure with creativity. A warm terracotta color suggests passion and artistry, and the
            muted sage green reflects balance and thoughtful reflection.
          </p>

          <h3>Tools & Techniques</h3>
          <p>
            The logo was designed in Inkscape using geometric shapes and path operations. I began with two overlapping
            circles, converting them into paths to construct the infinity symbol. Inside the left loop, a terracotta
            semicircle holds simplified piano keys made from narrow rectangles in alternating tones. The sage green and
            terracotta palette reinforces a calm yet creative atmosphere. Finally, the text “INFINITE KEYS STUDIO” was
            set in a modern sans-serif typeface and centered to create a clean, minimalist composition.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Through this image editing work, I deepened my understanding of how bitmap and vector tools support different
        kinds of visual problem-solving. GIMP allowed me to experiment with photographic composition, blending, and
        mood, while Inkscape required precise control of shapes, curves, and typography. Together, these projects
        helped me think more intentionally about how visual design can represent educational philosophies and invite
        viewers into an imaginative learning space.
